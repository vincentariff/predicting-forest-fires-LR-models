## Introduction

* IIn this project, we will predict the impact of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal using linear regression.

* We log-transformed the target variable, handled missing data with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation, identified outliers, standardized the dataset, and implemented multiple linear regression models. These included sequential feature selection (forward and backward), Ridge regression, and evaluation using K-Fold cross-validation.

*  Using linear regression to predict forest fire damage didnâ€™t yield satisfactory results. The right-skewed distribution of the target variable, with many extreme values near zero, disrupts the linearity between the predictors and the target variable.

## Dataset

* The dataset [_Forest Fires_](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires) is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repositor, with a slightly modified version tailored for our specific needs.
* The dataset can be found in `fires.csv` file.
